â˜• Java Projects â€” by Polo

Hey! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Polo, and this repo is where Iâ€™m building my personal collection of Java projects â€” from small practice exercises to more complete applications.

Itâ€™s basically my Java journey in one place: a mix of learning, experimenting, and constantly improving. Youâ€™ll find projects that cover OOP, data structures, algorithms, and other core concepts I explore as I grow as a developer.

I see this repository as both my learning log and my Java portfolio, showing how my code (and understanding) evolves over time.

Each project has its own README with a short description, goals, and lessons learned.
Feel free to explore or reach out if youâ€™ve got tips or feedback â€” Iâ€™m always grateful to learn from fellow developers ðŸ™Œ

Stay tuned for my progress ðŸš€
